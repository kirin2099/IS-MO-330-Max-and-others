                 assists users in keeping track of their projects progress. The board is monitored and referred
                  to by the team and shows all tasks during daily meetings, keeping the team focused on the remaining
                   tasks and goals. The Scrumboard application has the functionality to create a project and add members,
                    creating notes that are first stored in a backlog, users can then add tasks to the note to be 
                    completed as well as remove tasks. Users can also drag and drop the notes from different parts of the
                     scrumboard into other parts of the board e.g. move notes out of the backlog into the to do category or 
                     in progress category for instance. Developers will be able to drag avatars that represent developers
                      who are working on a specific task on to the notes to make it clear who is doing what task. The notes
                       will be customisable, users will have the option to change the colour and font of the notes. The 
                       Scrumboard application includes a calendar feature that can be used to set deadlines and save the state
                        of the notes on a given day to keep a timeline of the project’s development. When tasks are completed
                         they will be moved to the done pile.</td>

                     applications by adding a calendar features to track projects and set deadlines. Furthermore, our team thought
                      that it would be a great project to challenge ourselves and become familiar with new programming languages,

Information gathered from both last semesters subjects as well as from this semesters study combined with the information gathered from research will allow us to be adequately prepared for the task at hand.  
      However, it will not be easy to grasp some of the newer more complicated concepts with the basic knowledge that we have acquired previously. To efficiently work through this project, we will have to identify each team members strengths and use them to our advantage in completing this project by splitting the workload between ourselves according to our strengths. But in order to make sure that each team member gets some experience in each part of the coding procedure and functions we will read the comments left by the programmer and

      As having a database is a major feature of our project it is important for us to be able to create a database that is both functional and effective, many of the functions that are tied to project require the database to be functional in order to operate. Though this task will be delegated between team members all the members

      Our aim is to create a UI that uses conventional styles to create an effective and easy to use UI that will allow the user to quickly complete the tasks that they wish to on the application. As our project is a scrum board, helping users to efficiently use their time to reach their objectives, it is important  to us 
      that the users are not wasting their time on their tasks rather than our application, which can also deter potential users. When creating the UI, we will make sure that each team member has input in the design stage to assure a project that we are all pleased with.</tr>

           acquiring skills through research, which be one of our other major resources, they will later use these skills in finishing the functions that were assigned for them. Once each function is completed the other team members will have a look at the code to grasp how each
            function of the application is carried out by that section of code.</tr>

    <td class="pwhen">Within our Scrum Board idea we’ve decided on enlisting a unique feature which is a calendar, the calendar  will be able to set dates and view the states of the scrum board at different dates, this feature will allow users to easily view project deadlines. The risks of this feature within our project
       is its implementation due to most of the group members lacking coding skills as most of us are beginners. By having this as one of our main and unique features we risk the ability to complete the project or fulfill the intended result as we may not be well prepared or are unable to implement the feature in the short span of time.   
      Certain tools or rather expertise that we are lacking are the coding skills to implement the calendar feature, other resources we are limited by are time. Time is a factor that can influence how much effort we will put into creating the application as well as the learning curve required to build this application.   
       To resolve this major issue, we have access to numerous resources on both canvas, YouTube and other websites that can help our team by giving us a starting point to implement the feature within our website.   </td>

  <tr>
    <td class="pwhen">
      A major risk that comes with creating the scrum board is the originality of the idea, as there are already many other scrum board applications and websites out there that we need to compete against and make ours stand out, the risks for creating a scrum board idea is the possibility of it being the same as others. 
      Although we have all the tools to create the project there is always the uncertainty that the project could offer nothing unique to other competitors out there, as it could be too similar to other scrum board like applications and therefore not stand out as much as our team would of hoped. 
      Although there seems to be many variants of the kanban/scrum board, ours tries to resolve this by focusing on being project oriented rather than general use, this is done through setting up scrum boards with 5 columns for the projects in the order of Backlog, To Do, Dev, Test and Release. By having a more project-oriented scrum board our project has the potential of standing out as users may be attracted to the sole idea of project management within a scrum board with a calendar feature.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="pwhen">
        The implementation of the commit button is a potential risk for our project. The commit button is crucial for the setup of our database and its functionality, setting this up is a risk as it proves to be a problem in terms of programming, this feature also poses a risk in the sense of implementation of security protocols for privacy principles and user data storage. 
        Setting up the database and programming the commit button to store the layout of the database seems to be a daunting task. as previously mentioned most of us are new to programming, some members seem to have experience in setting up databases which does reduce the difficulty of this task. Other resources we may need to access are privacy policy rules and following Australian regulations of storing user data. 
        This risk can be solved through members doing heavy research into the implementation of the commit button and the database through YouTube or other resources. This could be considered a minor risk as some members are more comfortable in dealing with this feature. To resolve the risk of data storage we may need to include user disclosure when storing their data as well as the privacy policies which we may need to conduct research on as well.

                                   mixed between channels, this can be managed by having all files uploaded to the main channel.
                                 For communication within our group, we seem to be less interactive outside our group meetings,
                                  this can be solved by updating what each member is working on every 2nd or 3rd day. Lastly time
                                   management seems to be somewhat of an issue as some members tend to be late or can’t arrive at some
