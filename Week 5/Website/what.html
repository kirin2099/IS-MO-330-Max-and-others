              <h2>Max Simms-Walker</h2>
              <h2> S385347 </h2>
              <h3>Background and Passion in IT </h3>
              <p>I am an Australian student studying a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. 
                I enjoy travelling, meeting new people, playing basketball, cooking, movies and cats. 
                My passions in I.T. includes web development, UX/UI design and cyber security. </p>
                <h3>What are you good at/interested in?</h3>
                <p>I am good at using HTML and CSS as well as using designing tools like FIGMA, 
                I also know some basic JavaScript, java, SQL, node.js and php. I am interested 
                in making/designing websites.  </p>
                <h3>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</h3>
                <p>My weaker points would be programming, I do not feel as comfortable 
                as I would like to be programming so I need to improve upon my programming skills. 
                Furthermore, I have little experience using git and designing software. However, 
                I know how to create repositories and upload file onto AWS and Github. </p>
                <h3>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</h3>
                <p>I expect to be performing the job of designing the software 
                and implementing features in the application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

              <h2>Benjamin Vo</h2>
              <h2> S385347 </h2>
              <h3>Background and Passion in IT </h3>
              <p>I’m a current student at RMIT, an undergraduate doing bachelor of IT with plans
                to hopefully do a masters degree as well. I’ve done VCE software development and
                various other computer related subjects in high school. I enjoy learning about PC
                hardware and would like to be in the field of Cybersecurity. From a young age, I’ve 
                played with computer and few sorts of components with my father, thus getting me really 
                interested in pursuing a career around it  </p>
                <h3>What are you good at/interested in?</h3>
                <p>I’m interested in playing video games a lot. Regarding the field of IT, I'd say
                I’m decent/is interested in the design aspect of IT (UX/UI). I’m decent at doing Java
                programming but my general confidence in Java is still lacking.   </p>
                <h3>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</h3>
                <p>Weaker points in the context of the project would be the coding aspects of the
                mobile application as I’ve personally have never touched or been around the
                process of app development. </p>
                <h3>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</h3>
                <p>The role that I expect to be playing would probably be coding a few functionalities 
                of the app. Would like to help in also designing the application’s aesthetics as well. </p>

              <h2> S3836781 </h2>
              <h3>Background and Passion in IT </h3>
              <p>First year student in Bachelors of IT, changed course from an engineering diploma 
                to this degree due to the wide range of possibilities in the future. I am personally 
                into business IT and analytics but is also keen to learn all of aspects of IT.</p>
                <h3>What are you good at/interested in?</h3>
                <p>I would say that my java is decent from semester 1 programming course and I can do basic HTML and CSS. 
                Since starting my degree, I have developed an interest in the business side of IT. </p>
                <h3>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</h3>
                <p>I would say that my HTML and CSS needs some brushing up to do as most of my modules this semester requires 
                both HTML and CSS. Thus, this web application project will help me improve in that aspect. </p>
                <h3>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</h3>
                <p>A role that will help improve my programming skills and designing would be ideal.</p>

              <h2>Yashraj Mewada</h2>
              <h2> s3841523 </h2>
              <h3>Background and Passion in IT </h3>
              <p>I am a first year in Bachelor of Computing Studies, I've got very little background
                 in IT since it’s my first year, but I've always been interested in the development
                  of new technology. </p>
                <h3>What are you good at/interested in?</h3>
                <p>In my personal life I'd say I'm interested in gaming, physical activities, going to gym and a 
                  bit of travelling and photography. Within the IT field I'd say I'm mainly interested within the 
                  designing and business aspects of IT. I can’t say I'm good at programming or databases, but I've 
                  managed to learn a bit of java and SQL in the last semester and have a basic understanding of it.</h3>
                  <h3>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</h3>
                  <p>My weakest points would mainly be the programming aspects of it due the fact that I've just recently
                    learned the language like many other but also the fact that I struggle with it the most. </p>
                  <h3>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</h3>
                <p>Although I'm expected to be performing roles evenly within the group as programming seems to be the
                   most difficult tasks.</p>

              <h2>s3839956</h2>
              <h3>Background and Passion in IT </h3>
              <p>A student that enjoyed going out and was enjoying life before quarantine. Currently studying Bachelor
                 of IT and completed VCE Software Development. IT knowledge has been proven to be important and I aspire
                  to broaden my knowledge as well work in the IT industry in the future. </p>
                <h3>What are you good at/interested in?</h3>
                <p>I am interested in one day being able to create my own app, it is a dream of mine to create an app that
                   will be viral but even if it does not gain popularity I’d like to create an app for it to be part of my 
                   portfolio. I am a bit more enthusiastic about designing the interfaces of applications, this might be 
                   because I am not that confident with my coding skills. However, I do enjoy the backend coding and improving 
                   my coding skills as well. Outside of the IT world I enjoy gaming and physical activities as well as going 
                   out whenever possible.</p>
                  <h3>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</h3>
                  <p>I think creating and managing data bases will be one of my weaker points, however I am studying Practical
                     Database Concepts as a subject this semester and I believe that it will be extremely helpful going forward 
                     with our project idea.</p>
                  <h3>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</h3>
                <p>I will be more than happy to take on tasks that will require me to use skills such as design and programming
                   as well tasks linked to databases in order to boost my confidence in each of these areas.</p>

                     in learning JavaScript as well because I believe it’s vital to improve functionality on web pages. I have also used Figma as
                    a prototyping tool in the past and have basic knowledge of MySQL lite.</p>
                    <h3>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</h3>
